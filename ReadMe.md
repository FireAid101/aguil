# AGUIL
AGUIL stands for Another GUI Library

This is a single dependency (SDL2) GUI library focused on rapid form development with the code base and the form edtior

## Why
Well I don't really want to use C# for my forms and I want a simple but powerful solution for cross platform GUI development. I used to use Pascal and Delphi with their form builders. Which my library takes after in some but not all ways
